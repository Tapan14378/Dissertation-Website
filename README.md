### Ride-sharing website

## Running the Server

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   python myapp.py

This will load the application on your local server.

## Using the Website

Once the server is running, you can use the website. Follow these steps:

1. Access the website in your web browser.

2. The first page you'll see is the login and registration page.

3. To test the website, you need to create a new account. Use the registration page to provide your details and create an account.

4. Log in to the website using the credentials you just registered with. This will redirect you to the dashboard.

5. In the dashboard, you will find two options:

***New Request:*** Use this option to submit a new request.

***Results:*** Clicking this button triggers the solver to run on the database.

## Note: 

Please note that to fully test and see the results of the website, it's recommended to create multiple user accounts. This is because the matching and results depend on requests submitted by different user IDs. Requests generated by a single user ID may not have anything to match with.
